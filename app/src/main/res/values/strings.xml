        You are a captain leading a group of pirates to find the hidden treasures on the island.
        When you tap "Play Game" button, you will be introduced to a grid. Each cell in the grid
        represents an area on the island where a treasure chest may be hidden. You will tap on an
        area where you think the treasure chest is located. If the treasure chest is found in that
        area, you will see the treasure chest pop up. If there is no treasure chest, then you will
        see a number that represents the total number of treasure chests present in that row and
        column. The game will count the total number of taps you have done on areas without any
        treasure chests. Each tap represents 1hr of time wasted. The objective is to find all
        the treasure quickly before other pirates discover the hidden treasures!\n
