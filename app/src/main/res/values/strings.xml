        Bugs Bunny and the other Looney Tunes characters have misplaced all the bombs that
        they were planning to use as part of their shenanigans. It is your job to find all the bombs
        so that unsuspecting characters do not get hurt! When you tap "Play Game" button, you will
        be introduced to a grid. Each cell in the grid represents an area where some character
        may have misplaced the bomb. You will tap on an area where you think the bomb is located.
        If the bomb is found in that area, you will see the bomb pop up. If there is no bomb,
        then you will see a number that represents the total number of bombs there are present in
        that row and column. The game will count the total number of taps you have done on areas
        without any bombs. Each tap represents 1hr of time wasted. The objective is to find all
        the bombs quickly!\n
